Errors And Warning And Fixed Code


In the WrappedSingleListItem component, the onClickHandler prop is not called correctly.
It should be passed as a function, but instead, it's being called immediately with the index parameter. 
To fix this, change onClickHandler(index) to () => onClickHandler(index).

In the SingleListItem component, the isSelected prop is not passed correctly 
to the WrappedSingleListItem component. It should be passed as a boolean, but instead, 
it's being passed as the selectedIndex state variable.
To fix this, change isSelected={selectedIndex} to isSelected={selectedIndex === index}.

In the WrappedListComponent component, the items prop type is not defined correctly. 
There is no function "shapeOf" so instead of it we will write "shape"
There is no PropTypes.array  so we will write PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ ... })).


In the WrappedListComponent component, the setSelectedIndex state variable is being set incorrectly.
It should be set using the useState hook like this: const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(-1);.

In the WrappedListComponent component, the useEffect hook is missing a dependency array. 
It should have [items] as its dependency array to properly reset the selectedIndex state variable 
when the items prop changes.

In the WrappedListComponent component, the items prop is not being checked for null or undefined 
before being used in the useEffect hook. To fix this, change the useEffect hook to this:


useEffect(() => {
setSelectedIndex(-1);
}, [items ]);


In the WrappedListComponent component, the items prop default value is not defined correctly. 
It should be an empty array, not null. To fix this, change items: null to items: [].
